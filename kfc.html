                  <h3>KFC</h3>
                  <p>Long before KFC became the most popular fried chicken chain in the world, the entire company consisted of a single roadside restaurant opened and operated by one Colonel Harland Sanders in the midst of the Great Depression. From these humble and challenging beginnings, KFC has grown to become a worldwide franchise with an estimated value of $8.5 billion and has earned a place at 86th on the Worldâ€™s Most Valuable Brands 2019 list.</p>
